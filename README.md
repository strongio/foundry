# Foundry

A helpful library of functions useful for predictive analytics, ML modelling, and ML evaluation. 

Foundry includes:
- a selection of torch-accelerated GLM models, in `foundry.glm`
- quality-of-life extensions to `scikit-learn`. Most notably in `foundry.preprocessing` 
- model evaluation (and visualizations) in `foundry.evaluation`
- and more to come!

## Getting Started

``foundry`` can be installed with `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/strongio/foundry.git#egg=foundry
